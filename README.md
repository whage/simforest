# Simforest: an ecological simulation

This is how I'm learning to program in Go.

## TODO
- one tile can be occupied by one ctreature only
- pure random movement is stupid. Do something much more realistic
- use some builtin vector type instead of custom `Position`
- learn how to do "inheritance" in go
    - how to share code between related objects (as in parent class's method in classical OOP)

    - https://github.com/bvwells/go-patterns
- use `float64` for Positions
- evolution of species
	- inheriting favorable abilities
- add diverse set of terrain types and creatures
- move to pixel-based graphics
	- raylib?
- implement an environment that is larger than the viewport (arbitrary world size)
	- make it possible to move the view
- procedurally generated terrain
	- 3D eventually?
